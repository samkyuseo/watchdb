# watchdb

Decided to spin out watchstreet.io's backend and webcrawlers as a seperate service. This will allow other developers to create their own watch tech without having to build and run their own crawlers.

## Scrapers

This project is a scrapy project created using `scrapy startproject`.

```
python -m venv venv
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## APIs

For now, look at `back` folder in `github.com/samkyuseo/watchstreet`
