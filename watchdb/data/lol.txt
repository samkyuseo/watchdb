When people look at a GMT, one of the first things that tends to catch their eye is the bezel, and that is why many collectors, and those looking for a GMT in particular, can get a bit obsessed with finding that perfect bezel. The colors have stayed vibrant, with a small amount of fade on the blue portion, and the red half has a beautiful, almost raspberry coloring when the light hits it at just the right angle.\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eGMT Masters continue to be some of the most sought after and collectible watches out there and this is an excellent opportunity to get an uncommon dial variation in great condition.

Add to that the gold \"nipple\" hour markers and the gilt text, which each fit quite nicely with the light yellow patina on the lume.

The DS divers, a few of which we have been happy to offer in the past, have taken hold in the larger vintage collecting universe over the past few years.

Modern Certina is having a bit of a moment as well here at the HODINKEE as the brand recently \u003c\/span\u003e\u003ca href=\"https:\/\/shop.hodinkee.com\/blogs\/journal\/certina-usa-dsph200-ph500-action-gmt\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-href=\"https:\/\/shop.hodinkee.com\/blogs\/journal\/certina-usa-dsph200-ph500-action-gmt\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ereturned to the U.S. market\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/a\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e exclusively through the Shop.\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eWith that growing appreciation, more attention has come to the lesser known Certina watches as collectors come to understand the build quality of the brand. Lesser known watches like this humble dress watch in 18k yellow gold. Whereas other brands that remain under-the-radar in the vintage world can sometimes disappoint in build quality, Certina impresses even the most seasoned of collectors. You can feel the difference right in your hand.\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eWhile the case is simple with four sharp lugs, this Certina's dial and hands are stunning and extremely well made. You can see the attention to detail in the black paint portion of the hands which ties into the black color within each hour marker as well as the simple vertically brushed finish. We are continually attracted to these non-lume watches as they can be worn a bit more worry-free. A simple knock on the table or door jam will not lead to damage to those pesky and fragile lume plots.\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eLike Cole P says \"Always read the caseback.\" Turning this Certina around we find an engraving depicting The Three Crowns of Sweden, the national emblem, and reading \"FÖR NIT OCH REDLIGHET I RIKETS TJÄNST\" or, translated from Swedish, \"for zeal and honesty in service of the kingdom\" we can assume this watch was a gift given by a member of the Kingdom of Sweden to a great citizen or friend of the state.\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eThis example is in really excellent condition with some light patina that presents nicely.

The other watches included the Autavia ref. 1163 and the Monaco ref. 1133. Heuer was part of a coalition of brands – including Breitling, Dubois-Dépraz, and Hamilton-Buren – that helped bring one of the earliest automatic chronographs to market. Unlike the Monaco, which was a completely new watch for Heuer when it was introduced in 1969, the Carrera ref. 1153 was intended to be an evolution of the original Carrera, introduced in 1963.\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eThe Carrera ref. 1153 retained the inner tension ring characteristic of the Carrera line that could display additional information, like the seconds track on the ref. 2447. Instead, the ref. 1153 used this inner ring to display a tachymeter track (and, in rare instances, other types of scales), with the seconds track on the edge of the dial itself. The new C-shaped case profile would give the Carrera a more modern 1970s feel, and now with an automatic movement, Heuer moved the crown to the other side of case, making it instantly recognizable as a self-winding watch with caliber 11. \u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eThe example we have here features a beautiful blue dial, a strong case, a correct Gay Frères \"beads-of-rice\" style bracelet, and the upgraded caliber 12 movement.

The other watches included the Autavia ref. 1163 and the Monaco ref. 1133. Heuer was part of a coalition of brands – including Breitling, Dubois-Dépraz, and Hamilton-Buren – that helped bring one of the earliest automatic chronographs to market. Unlike the Monaco, which was a completely new watch for Heuer when it was introduced in 1969, the Carrera ref. 1153 was intended to be an evolution of the original Carrera, introduced in 1963.\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eThe Carrera ref. 1153 retained the inner tension ring characteristic of the Carrera line that could display additional information, like the seconds track on the ref. 2447. Instead, the ref. 1153 used this inner ring to display a tachymeter track (and, in rare instances, other types of scales), with the seconds track on the edge of the dial itself. The new C-shaped case profile would give the Carrera a more modern 1970s feel, and now with an automatic movement, Heuer moved the crown to the other side of case, making it instantly recognizable as a self-winding watch with caliber 11. \u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eThe example we have here features a beautiful blue dial, a strong case, a correct Gay Frères \"beads-of-rice\" style bracelet, and the upgraded caliber 12 movement.

The brand began offering watches in mixed metal beginning in the 1940s and 50s. We think Danny is onto something here. Two-tone isn't ugly, but it does need to be executed well. In the case of this ref. 1675\/3 GMT, the mix of steel and gold just works.\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eWith the ref. 16753, the second generation of the two-tone GMT, there are a few differentiating characteristics both in design and functionality. First, as a watch from the late 1970s, we get some creature comfort in a quick-set date function made possible by the updated Rolex caliber 3075 inside. Secondly, this 16753 retains an acrylic crystal. Around this period, Rolex was transitioning to sapphire but examples with the older material have the added benefit of that hint of vintage charm. A design aspect that Rolex fans love about the earliest two-tone GMTs  is what is known as the \"nipple dial.\" The name comes from the smaller, circular, applied hour markers with luminous material in their centers. Rolex stuck to the iconic hour marker design in early ref. 16753 examples before moving to larger, more standard, applied hour markers.\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eThis example of the GMT-Master serves as a great reminder of how two-tone can just work in the right execution. The overall black and gold motif of this watch is really pleasing in the metal and stunning on the wrist. With a bit of patina developing to the lume on the hands and on the applied markers here, the look is even furthered.

The brand began offering watches in mixed metal beginning in the 1940s and 50s. We think Danny is onto something here. Two-tone isn't ugly, but it does need to be executed well. In the case of this ref. 1675\/3 GMT, the mix of steel and gold just works.\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eWith the ref. 16753, the second generation of the two-tone GMT, there are a few differentiating characteristics both in design and functionality. First, as a watch from the late 1970s, we get some creature comfort in a quick-set date function made possible by the updated Rolex caliber 3075 inside. Secondly, this 16753 retains an acrylic crystal. Around this period, Rolex was transitioning to sapphire but examples with the older material have the added benefit of that hint of vintage charm. A design aspect that Rolex fans love about the earliest two-tone GMTs  is what is known as the \"nipple dial.\" The name comes from the smaller, circular, applied hour markers with luminous material in their centers. Rolex stuck to the iconic hour marker design in early ref. 16753 examples before moving to larger, more standard, applied hour markers.\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eThis example of the GMT-Master serves as a great reminder of how two-tone can just work in the right execution. The overall black and gold motif of this watch is really pleasing in the metal and stunning on the wrist. With a bit of patina developing to the lume on the hands and on the applied markers here, the look is even furthered. The color of the lume looks closer to a gold rather than cream, especially with the gold metal surrounding it. There's no better bracelet for this watch than the two-tone Oyster, a bracelet that has become iconic in its own right.

The viewing experience is enhanced even further with Dolby Atmos, a function where sound moves around you in a three dimensional space. Beosound Stage includes eleven speaker drivers each driven by its own amplifier, and the result is a three-channel, fully active, DSP based loudspeaker solution delivering a superbly deep and rich performance.\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\" data-mce-style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eThe basic TV sound setup of Beosound Stage only requires you to connect the included HDMI cable between Beosound Stage and the HDMI ARC connection of your TV. Then, select correct speaker\/sound output in your TV menu. Through the Bang \u0026amp; Olufsen App, once you register the product, you can choose among different \"listening modes\" according to what you are listening or watching on tv.

Dupont lighters. S.T. Dupont creates finely crafted tools that produce a perfect, gentle flame. To call it a lighter simply wouldn’t do it justice. We've partnered with S.T.

Of course there’s the audible “ping” that's come to characterize opening an S.T. Dupont lighter, but the HODINKEE limited edition version carries over more than precise mechanical engagement; it draws inspiration from the quintessential lighters S.T. Dupont was making in the 1940s-1960s. The iconic lines, a carefully machined flint wheel, and a gorgeous lacquer finish are all hallmarks of classic S.T. Dupont styling that have made their way into this edition. \u003c\/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan class=\"s1\"\u003e\u003c\/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan class=\"s1\"\u003eThe Ligne 2 for HODINKEE comes in specially made packaging inspired by archival examples of Dupont packaging from the mid-1900s.

Dupont lighters. S.T. Dupont creates finely crafted tools that produce a perfect, gentle flame. To call it a lighter simply wouldn’t do it justice. We've partnered with S.T.

Of course there’s the audible “ping” that's come to characterize opening an S.T. Dupont lighter, but the HODINKEE limited edition version carries over more than precise mechanical engagement; it draws inspiration from the quintessential lighters S.T. Dupont was making in the 1940s-1960s. The iconic lines, a carefully machined flint wheel, and a gorgeous lacquer finish are all hallmarks of classic S.T. Dupont styling that have made their way into this edition. \u003c\/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan class=\"s1\"\u003e\u003c\/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan class=\"s1\"\u003eThe Ligne 2 for HODINKEE comes in specially made packaging inspired by archival examples of Dupont packaging from the mid-1900s.
